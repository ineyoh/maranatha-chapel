              Serve the Lord with gladness: come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God: 
              it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, 
              and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

            To have unlimited access into God's presence, genuine worship, wholehearted praises and thanksgiving are the keys.

              Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.

            God's will for us is to pray without relenting. The prayer group offers intercessory prayer with the help of the Holy Spirit as in Romans 8:26 for the church. 
            Christ has instructed the church to put on His whole Armour as we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, 
            against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.</p>
